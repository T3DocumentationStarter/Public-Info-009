`wiki: Stack Overflow <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow>`__ is part of the 
`wiki: Stack Exchange <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange>`__ network.      

Stack Exchange
==============

The Stack Exchange network includes other sites which are handled like StackOverflow  
but with different topics and partially different rules. While StackOverflow's topic is 
"Computer Proramming" and english only other **areas** can have other topics and 
sometimes other languages.  
There are some areas which cover the programming topic but are for other languages than english.  
Some Areas have topics which overlap with StackOverflow (programming) but they specialise the
covered range like a special programming language, or a framework, or a CMS.  
Other Areas have completly different topic with no relation to programming or computer like 
Puzzling_, Coffee_ or multiple languages (e.g. questions about german idioms, don't confuse 
with programming questions in non english languages). 
There is an `Overview <http://stackexchange.com/sites>`_ to all these Areas.

New Areas
---------

New Areas can be created by active users, following the rules given in area51_.

Here we can create our own area for TYPO3 which can hold questions and answers 
to all topics of TYPO3 (not only programming). We might change the neccessarity 
for only english question: As not all TYPO3 users and interestets speak english 
well we might help them by accepting an automatic translation, which could be 
enhanced by others as the original (german, french, spanish, ...) question could
be added after the automatic translated english version. 

Now (nov 2016) we are in the second phase of the 
`proposal <http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/102804/typo3>`_ for 
**typo3.stackexchange.com**, gathering enough experienced Stack Overflow/ 
StackExchange users who commit to active use the new area.  
When there will be enough commitments the **private beta** will start where 
only commiter can use the new area and answer the questions gathered in the first
phase. After enough participation the **public beta** will enable everyone to
participate. On enough regular traffic in this area it is possible to get an 
own design. 

For starting the private beta it is neccessary to have at least 

- 200 committers, 
- 100 Committers which have a reputation of more than 200 in another stack-exchange area
- a committment score, which is based on the committers activity on all 
  other sites and how old the commitment is

The progress of the proposal in the `overview <http://area51.stackexchange.com/>`__ 
is the minimum percentage of these three values.

And so the number of committers has not changed since some days, the least value 
of the TYPO3 proposal is the second value. Here we need more activity of everyone 
on any stack exchange area. This might also be stack overflow, where everyone already
can ask and answer questions about TYPO3. Be more active!

As the committment score will lower with time you can refresh your committment by 
visiting the proposal page while logged in.
